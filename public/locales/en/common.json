    "mainContent":"Welcome to my project Herytage, inspired by my mother's hobby for tracing our family history. This website is a tool to help her with her efforts to manage and save records of our ancestors, and to preserve their legacy for future generations. As I work on this project, I am continually amazed by the depth and complexity of our family tree, and the many fascinating characters who populate its branches. I hope that by sharing our family's history in this way, I can inspire others to explore their own family histories. So come along with me on this journey, and let's discover the hidden gems of our past together."
